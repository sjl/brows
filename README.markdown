`brows` is a small utility to open URLs in browsers.  It's intended to be
a (slightly) more configurable [urlview](https://github.com/sigpipe/urlview) in
Common Lisp.

It's not quite ready for public consumption.  I'm currently dogfooding it, but
polishing might take a while.  Run at your own risk and be willing to read the
code for documentation right now.
